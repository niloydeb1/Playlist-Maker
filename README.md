## Project Features:
Implemented features: 
1.	Look & Feel: It is proven that users are more attracted to simple and easy to use websites. Keeping that in mind, my website demonstrates a simple look and well-addressed features. Hence, the users will be more comfortable using it.

User can sign-up and if password does not match with retyped password or for any redundant user sign-up, will be restricted from signing-up and appropriate message will be shown.
5.	Playlist Panel: After successful login, user will be brought into home page where user can view the playlists that user has already created. User can also logout, create playlist, delete playlist, add video to particular playlist from here.
6.	Create Playlist: User can create playlist by providing name and description of the playlist. Duplicate playlist will result into error with appropriate message.
7.	Delete Playlist: User can choose any available playlist to delete. User will be shown a Confirm dialogue box before deletion.
